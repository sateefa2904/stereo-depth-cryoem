# Stereo Depth Estimation on Cryo-EM Slices

![Stereo Vision Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sateefa2904/stereo-depth-cryoem/main/results/disparity_map.png)

A compact yet powerful stereo vision pipeline built around 3D biological data. This project demonstrates depth map generation and 3D surface visualization using stereo pairs extracted from a synthetic Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) volume.

> This is a general idea of the stereo algorithm I'm implementing in my research. Due to confidentiality, I cannot share real UTSW data or code directly. The project is part of an ongoing study on protein structural modeling in Cryo-EM reconstructions.

## Project Overview

This repository walks through:

- Loading a `.mat`-based synthetic Cryo-EM 3D volume mimicking amyloid fibril structures
- Extracting two axial slices as a stereo pair (z=44 and z=46)
- Normalizing and saving the stereo images
- Computing disparity using OpenCV's `StereoBM`
- Visualizing the resulting depth map in 3D using matplotlib
- Exporting animated disparity results

## Why Cryo-EM + Stereo Vision?

Cryo-EM (Cryogenic Electron Microscopy) is used to capture volumetric scans of biomolecules. By treating adjacent axial slices as left/right views, we can test stereo vision techniques on biomedical data.

This synthetic dataset is inspired by amyloid fibril stacking patterns. In real datasets, such disparity-driven depth estimation could complement segmentation tasks or be integrated into 3D structural prediction pipelines.

---

## Research Connection
This stereo vision pipeline models a subset of methods I am applying in my current research at UTSW, where I work on neural approaches to Cryo-EM volume interpretation and alignment. Though the research involves real amyloid reconstructions, those datasets remain private. This public-facing version is a faithful conceptual demonstration designed for publication and portfolio purposes, and reflects potential research directions aligned with KAUST’s bioinformatics and computer vision interests.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Future Ideas
- Swap StereoBM with `StereoSGBM` for smoother disparity
- Apply to real EMPIAR or RELION-aligned stacks
- Integrate with segmentation or refinement networks
- Auto-generate stereo pairs from 3D density maps
- Adapt pipeline for contrast transfer function (CTF)-aware pre-processing
